# NewspeakTranslator
This is a program which attempts to translate modern English (Oldspeak) to 1984's language of Newspeak, going beyond replacing certain preset words.

If you want to translate a paragraph: paste it into a text file, type "%FILE" into the Oldspeak input, and then type the file name, including the file extension. Otherwise simply enter your text.
